# Stable Diffusion + FastAPI

Personal implementation of CompVis' Open-source diffusion model together with FastAPI running on personal laptop.
Since the laptop is old, the availabel GPU does not have enough VRAM for the model inference to take advantage of CUDA, so the average API reponse time is around 5 minutes.
